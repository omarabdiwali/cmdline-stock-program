# cmdline-stock-program
A small stock program that gives you a base amount to invest with.

Gives you a base amount to start with, and allows you to buy stocks with it. Stocks are stored on a database, which you could view.
You are able to check the values of your stock, by checking the net gain of when you bought it versus what the price is at currently.
It also allows you to sell stocks, and lets you give the amount of number you would want to sell.
Browsing the different stocks shows you the current price, the highest and lowest it was, the previous close, and the current date and time.

Put the money.txt and the main.py in the same folder, in the code the folder is called 'stocks', or change 'stocks' to the location of the money.

# Things to improve
- Making it faster, gather data asynchronously
- Possibly add an option for more than one player
- Making the code more concise
